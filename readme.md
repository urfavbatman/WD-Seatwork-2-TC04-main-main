## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Description of the project in details.

Guiding Question:
- The R1 Project is a team effort involving engineers, designers, and racing fans all working together to make the best racing bike ever. It starts with a lot of studying and testing by the engineers. They look at everything from how the bike moves through the air to how well the engine works. Then, the designers create a cool-looking frame that's comfy for riders and helps them go fast while feeling in control. It's all about making a bike that riders will love and that can win races.

- The R1 Project has two main goals: to make motorcycles better than ever and to give riders an amazing racing experience. We're using fancy technology and smart design to create a bike that's super fast and feels like an extension of the rider. The whole point is to get people excited about racing and to help them ride faster and better.

- The R1 Project's key components are what make it such an awesome racing machine:
-   ---Engine: The powerhouse gives you the speed you need to dominate the track.
-   ---Frame: Think of it as the bike's skeleton, designed to keep you stable and comfortable as you race around corners.
-   ---Aerodynamics: This is all about making the bike sleek and smooth, so it cuts through the air like a hot knife through butter, giving you that extra edge in speed.
-   ---Suspension: It's like the bike's shock absorbers, helping you stay in control even when the track gets bumpy.
-   ---Electronics: These fancy gadgets help keep you safe and ensure the bike performs at its best, giving you that extra confidence boost.
-   ---Brakes: Essential for slowing down when you need to, making sure you can tackle those hairpin turns without breaking a sweat.
-   ---Tires: Your connection to the track, gives you the grip you need to take those corners like a pro.
- The R1 Project uses some pretty cool tech to make riding safer, faster, and more fun:
-   ---Engine Wizardry: Imagine a brain for the engine that makes sure you get just the right amount of power whenever you twist the throttle. It's like having a super-smart engine that knows exactly what you need, whether you're cruising or tearing down the straight.
-   ---Electronic Guardian Angels: Ever felt your wheels slipping or your brakes locking up? That's where electronic aids come in. They're like little helpers that keep you in control, preventing skids and slides so you can focus on riding your best.
-   ---Slicing Through the Air: With the help of some fancy computer simulations and wind tunnel tests, the R1's design is like a bullet cutting through the wind. It means less drag, more speed, and better stability when you're flying around the track.
-   ---Smooth as Silk Suspension: The R1's suspension is like having your personal shock absorber. It soaks up bumps and dips in the road, keeping you steady and comfortable even when you're pushing the limits.
-   ---Featherweight Warrior: By using super-light materials like carbon fiber and titanium, the R1 sheds pounds without sacrificing strength. It's like having a nimble ninja bike that responds to every twist and turns with lightning-fast agility.
-   ---Data Detective: Ever wonder what happens behind the scenes while you're tearing up the track? The R1's onboard computer logs everything from your speed to your lean angle. It's like having a coach analyzing your every move, helping you fine-tune your performance for that extra edge.
